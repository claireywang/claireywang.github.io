For someone like me with little experience in computer coding, R was an easy program to transition into for manipulating, visualizing, and analyzing data. However, when Dr. Woodward started teaching Python, it was a foreign language to me, full of news things I had yet to learn. Why couldn't you simply have a file "copy to" a different location? Instead, the file has to be saved, then reuploaded in the desired location (so unnecessarily complicated). Why does index 2 mean position 1? What's the purpose of index 0? Despite my bias, many people out there still love Python (for reasons I don't quite understand). So here's a way for them to use it in conjunction with the fabulous R!
```{R}
library(reticulate)

library(datasets)
quakes <- quakes
```

Let's retrieve the dataset from R using Python.

```{python}
print(r.quakes.head())
```

```{R}

```
